#' Create a **pointblank** *agent* object
#'
#' @description
#' The `create_agent()` function creates an *agent* object, which is used in a
#' *data quality reporting* workflow. The overall aim of this workflow is to
#' generate useful reporting information for assessing the level of data quality
#' for the target table. We can supply as many validation functions as the user
#' wishes to write, thereby increasing the level of validation coverage for that
#' table. The *agent* assigned by the `create_agent()` call takes validation
#' functions, which expand to validation steps (each one is numbered). This
#' process is known as developing a *validation plan*.
#'
#' The validation functions, when called on an *agent*, are merely instructions
#' up to the point the [interrogate()] function is called. That kicks off the
#' process of the *agent* acting on the *validation plan* and getting results
#' for each step. Once the interrogation process is complete, we can say that
#' the *agent* has intel. Calling the *agent* itself will result in a reporting
#' table. This reporting of the interrogation can also be accessed with the
#' [get_agent_report()] function, where there are more reporting options.
#'
#' @section Data Products Obtained from an Agent:
#' A very detailed list object, known as an x-list, can be obtained by using the
#' [get_agent_x_list()] function on the *agent*. This font of information can be
#' taken as a whole, or, broken down by the step number (with the `i` argument).
#'
#' Sometimes it is useful to see which rows were the failing ones. By using the
#' [get_data_extracts()] function on the *agent*, we either get a list of
#' tibbles (for those steps that have data extracts) or one tibble if the
#' validation step is specified with the `i` argument.
#'
#' The target data can be split into pieces that represent the 'pass' and 'fail'
#' portions with the [get_sundered_data()] function. A primary requirement is an
#' agent that has had [interrogate()] called on it. In addition, the validation
#' steps considered for this data splitting need to be those that operate on
#' values down a column (e.g., the `col_vals_*()` functions or [conjointly()]).
#' With these in-consideration validation steps, rows with no failing test units
#' across all validation steps comprise the 'pass' data piece, and rows with at
#' least one failing test unit across the same series of validations constitute
#' the 'fail' piece.
#'
#' If we just need to know whether all validations completely passed (i.e., all
#' steps had no failing test units), the [all_passed()] function could be used
#' on the *agent*. However, in practice, it's not often the case that all data
#' validation steps are free from any failing units.
#' 
#' While printing an *agent* will display the *agent* report in the Viewer, we
#' can alternatively use the [get_agent_report()] to take advantage of other
#' options (e.g., overriding the language, modifying the arrangement of report
#' rows, etc.), and to return the report as independent objects. For example,
#' with the `display_table = TRUE` option (the default), [get_agent_report()]
#' will return a **gt** table object (`"gt_tbl"`). If `display_table` is set to
#' `FALSE`, we'll get a data frame back instead.
#' 
#' @section YAML: 
#' A **pointblank** agent can be written to YAML with [yaml_write()] and the
#' resulting YAML can be used to regenerate an agent (with [yaml_read_agent()])
#' or interrogate the target table (via [yaml_agent_interrogate()]). Here is an
#' example of how a complex call of `create_agent()` is expressed in R code and
#' in the corresponding YAML representation.
#' 
#' ```
#' # R statement
#' create_agent(
#'   read_fn = ~ small_table,
#'   tbl_name = "small_table",
#'   label = "An example.",
#'   actions = action_levels(
#'     warn_at = 0.10,
#'     stop_at = 0.25,
#'     notify_at = 0.35
#'   ), 
#'   end_fns = list(
#'     ~ beepr::beep(2),
#'     ~ Sys.sleep(1)
#'   ), 
#'   embed_report = TRUE,
#'   lang = "fr", 
#'   locale = "fr_CA"
#' )
#' 
#' # YAML representation
#' type: agent
#' read_fn: ~small_table
#' tbl_name: small_table
#' label: An example.
#' lang: fr
#' locale: fr_CA
#' actions:
#'   warn_fraction: 0.1
#' stop_fraction: 0.25
#' notify_fraction: 0.35
#' end_fns:
#' - ~beepr::beep(2)
#' - ~Sys.sleep(1)
#' embed_report: true
#' ```
#' 
#' In practice, this block of YAML will be shorter since arguments with default
#' values won't be written to YAML when using [yaml_write()] (though it is
#' acceptable to include them with their default when generating the YAML by
#' other means). The only requirement for writing the YAML representation of an
#' *agent* is having `read_fn` specified (any table supplied to `tbl` is
#' ignored).
#' 
#' What typically follows this chunk of YAML is a `steps` part, and that
#' corresponds to the addition of validation steps via validation functions.
#' Help articles for each validation function have a *YAML* section that
#' describes how a given validation function is translated to YAML.
#' 
#' Should you need to preview the transformation of an *agent* to YAML (without
#' any committing anything to disk), use the [yaml_agent_string()] function. If
#' you already have a `.yml` file that holds an *agent*, you can get a glimpse
#' of the R expressions that are used to regenerate that agent with
#' [yaml_agent_show_exprs()].
#' 
#' @section Writing an Agent to Disk:
#' An *agent* object can be written to disk with the [x_write_disk()] function.
#' This can be useful for keeping a history of validations and generating views
#' of data quality over time. Agents are stored in the serialized RDS format and
#' can be easily retrieved with the [x_read_disk()] function.
#'
#' It's recommended that table-prep formulas are supplied to the `read_fn`
#' argument of `create_agent()`. In this way, when an *agent* is read from disk
#' through [x_read_disk()], it can be reused to access the target table (which
#' may changed, hence the need to use an expression for this).
#' 
#' @section Combining Several Agents in a *multiagent* Object:
#' Multiple *agent* objects can be part of a *multiagent* object, and two
#' functions can be used for this: [create_multiagent()] and
#' [read_disk_multiagent()]. By gathering multiple agents that have performed
#' interrogations in the past, we can get a *multiagent* report showing how data
#' quality evolved over time. This use case is interesting for data quality
#' monitoring and management, and, the reporting (which can be customized with
#' [get_multiagent_report()]) is robust against changes in validation steps for
#' a given target table.
#'
#' @param tbl The input table. This can be a data frame, a tibble, a `tbl_dbi`
#'   object, or a `tbl_spark` object. Alternatively, a function can be used to
#'   read in the input data table with the `read_fn` argument (in which case,
#'   `tbl` can be `NULL`).
#' @param read_fn A table-prep formula that's used to access the target table.
#'   Even if a `tbl` is provided, this formula will be invoked to obtain the
#'   data (i.e., the `read_fn` takes priority). There are two ways to specify a
#'   `read_fn`: (1) with a right-hand side (RHS) formula expression (e.g.,
#'   `~ { <table reading code>}`) or (2) as a function (e.g., 
#'   `function() { <table reading code>}`).
#' @param tbl_name A optional name to assign to the input table object. If no
#'   value is provided, a name will be generated based on whatever information
#'   is available. This table name will be displayed in the header area of the
#'   agent report generated by printing the *agent* or calling
#'   [get_agent_report()].
#' @param label An optional label for the validation plan. If no value is
#'   provided, a label will be generated based on the current system time.
#'   Markdown can be used here to make the label more visually appealing (it
#'   will appear in the header area of the agent report).
#' @param actions A option to include a list with threshold levels so that all
#'   validation steps can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This
#'   is to be created with the [action_levels()] helper function. Should an
#'   action levels list be used for a specific validation step, the default set
#'   specified here will be overridden.
#' @param end_fns A list of expressions that should be invoked at the end of an
#'   interrogation. Each expression should be in the form of a one-sided R
#'   formula, so overall this construction should be used: `end_fns = list(~ <R
#'   statements>, ~ <R statements>, ...)`. An example of a function included in
#'   **pointblank** that can be sensibly used here is [email_blast()], which
#'   sends an email of the validation report (based on a sending condition).
#' @param embed_report An option to embed a **gt**-based validation report into
#'   the `ptblank_agent` object. If `FALSE` (the default) then the table object
#'   will be not generated and available with the *agent* upon returning from
#'   the interrogation.
#' @param lang The language to use for automatic creation of briefs (short
#'   descriptions for each validation step) and for the *agent report* (a
#'   summary table that provides the validation plan and the results from the
#'   interrogation. By default, `NULL` will create English (`"en"`) text. Other
#'   options include French (`"fr"`), German (`"de"`), Italian (`"it"`), Spanish
#'   (`"es"`), Portuguese, (`"pt"`), Chinese (`"zh"`), and Russian (`"ru"`).
#' @param locale An optional locale ID to use for formatting values in the
#'   *agent report* summary table according the locale's rules. Examples include
#'   `"en_US"` for English (United States) and `"fr_FR"` for French (France);
#'   more simply, this can be a language identifier without a country
#'   designation, like "es" for Spanish (Spain, same as `"es_ES"`).
#'   
#' @return A `ptblank_agent` object.
#'   
#' @examples
#' # Let's walk through a data quality
#' # analysis of an extremely small table;
#' # it's actually called `small_table` and
#' # we can find it as a dataset in this
#' # package
#' small_table
#' 
#' # We ought to think about what's
#' # tolerable in terms of data quality so
#' # let's designate proportional failure
#' # thresholds to the `warn`, `stop`, and
#' # `notify` states using `action_levels()`
#' al <- 
#'   action_levels(
#'       warn_at = 0.10,
#'       stop_at = 0.25,
#'     notify_at = 0.35
#'   )
#' 
#' # Now create a pointblank `agent` object
#' # and give it the `al` object (which
#' # serves as a default for all validation

#'     tbl_name = "small_table",
#'     label = "An example.",
#'     actions = al
#'   )
#'
#' # Then, as with any `agent` object, we
#' # can add steps to the validation plan by
#' # using as many validation functions as we
#' # want; then, we use `interrogate()` to
#' # physically perform the validations and
