#' Perform a specialized validation with a user-defined function
#'
#' @description 
#' The `specially()` validation function allows for custom validation with a
#' function that *you* provide. The major proviso for the provided function is
#' that it must either return a logical vector or a table where the final column
#' is logical. The function will operate on the table object, or, because you
#' can do whatever you like, it could also operate on other types of objects. To
#' do this, you can transform the input table in `preconditions` or inject an
#' entirely different object there. During interrogation, there won't be any
#' checks to ensure that the data is a table object.
#' 
#' @section Preconditions:
#' Providing expressions as `preconditions` means **pointblank** will preprocess
#' the target table during interrogation as a preparatory step. It might happen
#' that a particular validation requires a calculated column, some filtering of
#' rows, or the addition of columns via a join, etc. Especially for an
#' *agent*-based report this can be advantageous since we can develop a large
#' validation plan with a single target table and make minor adjustments to it,
#' as needed, along the way. Within `specially()`, because this function is
#' special, there won't be internal checking as to whether the
#' `preconditions`-based output is a table.
#'
#' The table mutation is totally isolated in scope to the validation step(s)
#' where `preconditions` is used. Using **dplyr** code is suggested here since
#' the statements can be translated to SQL if necessary (i.e., if the target
#' table resides in a database). The code is most easily supplied as a one-sided
#' **R** formula (using a leading `~`). In the formula representation, the `.`
#' serves as the input data table to be transformed (e.g., `~ . %>%
#' dplyr::mutate(col_b = col_a + 10)`). Alternatively, a function could instead
#' be supplied (e.g., `function(x) dplyr::mutate(x, col_b = col_a + 10)`).
#' 
#' @section Actions:
#' Often, we will want to specify `actions` for the validation. This argument,
#' present in every validation function, takes a specially-crafted list
#' object that is best produced by the [action_levels()] function. Read that
#' function's documentation for the lowdown on how to create reactions to
#' above-threshold failure levels in validation. The basic gist is that you'll
#' want at least a single threshold level (specified as either the fraction of
#' test units failed, or, an absolute value), often using the `warn_at`
#' argument. This is especially true when `x` is a table object because,
#' otherwise, nothing happens. For the `col_vals_*()`-type functions, using 
#' `action_levels(warn_at = 0.25)` or `action_levels(stop_at = 0.25)` are good
#' choices depending on the situation (the first produces a warning when a
#' quarter of the total test units fails, the other `stop()`s at the same
#' threshold level).
#' 
#' @section Briefs:
#' Want to describe this validation step in some detail? Keep in mind that this
#' is only useful if `x` is an *agent*. If that's the case, `brief` the agent
#' with some text that fits. Don't worry if you don't want to do it. The
#' *autobrief* protocol is kicked in when `brief = NULL` and a simple brief will
#' then be automatically generated.
#' 
#' @section YAML:
#' A **pointblank** agent can be written to YAML with [yaml_write()] and the
#' resulting YAML can be used to regenerate an agent (with [yaml_read_agent()])
#' or interrogate the target table (via [yaml_agent_interrogate()]). When
#' `serially()` is represented in YAML (under the top-level `steps` key as a
#' list member), the syntax closely follows the signature of the validation
#' function. Here is an example of how a complex call of `serially()` as a
#' validation step is expressed in R code and in the corresponding YAML
#' representation.
#' 
#' ```
#' # R statement
#' agent %>% 
#'   specially(
#'     fn = function(x) { ... },
#'     preconditions = ~ . %>% dplyr::filter(a < 10),
#'     actions = action_levels(warn_at = 0.1, stop_at = 0.2), 
#'     label = "The `specially()` step.",
#'     active = FALSE
#'   )
#' 
#' # YAML representation
#' steps:
#' - specially:
#'     fn: function(x) { ... }
#'     preconditions: ~. %>% dplyr::filter(a < 10)
#'     actions:
#'       warn_fraction: 0.1
#'       stop_fraction: 0.2
#'     label: The `specially()` step.
#'     active: false
#' ```
#' 
#' In practice, both of these will often be shorter as only the expressions for
#' validation steps are necessary. Arguments with default values won't be
#' written to YAML when using [yaml_write()] (though it is acceptable to include
#' them with their default when generating the YAML by other means). It is also
#' possible to preview the transformation of an agent to YAML without any
#' writing to disk by using the [yaml_agent_string()] function.
#'
#' @inheritParams col_vals_gt
#' @param fn A function that performs the specialized validation on the data. It
#'   must either return a logical vector or a table where the last column is a
#'   logical column.
#' 
#' @return For the validation function, the return value is either a
#'   `ptblank_agent` object or a table object (depending on whether an agent
#'   object or a table was passed to `x`). The expectation function invisibly
#'   returns its input but, in the context of testing data, the function is
#'   called primarily for its potential side-effects (e.g., signaling failure).
#'   The test function returns a logical value.
