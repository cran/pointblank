#' Read **pointblank** *agents* stored on disk as a *multiagent* 
#'
#' An *agent* or *informant* can be written to disk with the [x_write_disk()]
#' function. While useful for later retrieving the stored agent with
#' [x_read_disk()] it's also possible to read a series of on-disk agents with
#' the `read_disk_multiagent()` function, which creates a `ptblank_multiagent`
#' object. A *multiagent* object can also be generated via the
#' [create_multiagent()] function but is less convenient to use if one is just
#' using agents that have been previous written to disk.
#'
#' @param filenames The names of files (holding *agent* objects) that were
#'   previously written by [x_write_disk()].
#' @param pattern A regex pattern for accessing saved-to-disk *agent* files
#'   located in a directory (specified in the `path` argument).
#' @param path A path to a collection of files. This is either optional in the
#'   case that files are specified in `filenames` (the `path` combined with all
#'   `filenames`), or, required when providing a `pattern` for file names.
#'   
#' @return A `ptblank_multiagent` object.
