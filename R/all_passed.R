#' Did all of the validations fully *pass*?
#'
#' @description
#' Given an agent's validation plan that had undergone interrogation via
#' [interrogate()], did every single validation step result in zero *failing*
#' test units? Using the `all_passed()` function will let us know whether that's
#' `TRUE` or not.
#' 
#' @details
#' The `all_passed()` function provides a single logical value based on an
#' interrogation performed in the *agent*-based workflow. For very large-scale
#' validation (where data quality is a known issue, and is perhaps something to
#' be tamed over time) this function is likely to be less useful since it is
#' quite stringent (all test units must pass across all validation steps).
#' 
#' Should there be a requirement for logical values produced from validation, a
#' more flexible alternative is in using the test (`test_*()`) variants of the
#' validation functions. Each of those produce a single logical value and each
#' and have a `threshold` option for failure levels. Another option is to
#' utilize post-interrogation objects within the *agent*'s x-list (obtained by
#' using the [get_agent_x_list()] function). This allows for many possibilities
#' in producing a single logical value from an interrogation.
#'
#' @param agent An agent object of class `ptblank_agent`.
#' @param i A vector of validation step numbers. These values are assigned to
#'   each validation step by **pointblank** in the order of definition. If
#'   `NULL` (the default), all validation steps will be used for the evaluation
#'   of complete *passing*.
#'
#' @return A logical value.
#' 
#' @section Examples:
#' 
#' Create a simple table with a column of numerical values.
#' 
#' ```{r}
#' tbl <- dplyr::tibble(a = c(4, 5, 7, 8))
#' 
#' tbl
#' ```
#' 
#' Validate that values in column `a` are always greater than 4.
#' 
#' ```r
#' agent <-
#'   create_agent(tbl = tbl) %>%
#'   col_vals_gt(columns = vars(a), value = 3) %>%
#'   col_vals_lte(columns = vars(a), value = 10) %>%
#'   col_vals_increasing(columns = vars(a)) %>%
#'   interrogate()
#' ```
#' 
#' Determine if these column validations have all passed by using `all_passed()`
#' (they do).
#' 
#' ```r
#' all_passed(agent = agent)
#' ```
#' 
#' ```
#' #> [1] TRUE
#' ```
