be a path leading to and including the file. This is combined with any path
given in \code{subdir}.}

\item{repo}{The GitHub repository address in the format
\verb{username/repo[/subdir][@ref|#pull|@*release]}.}

\description{
The \code{from_github()} function is helpful for generating a valid URL that
points to a data file in a public GitHub repository. This function can be
used in the \code{file} argument of the \code{\link[=file_tbl]{file_tbl()}} function or anywhere else
where GitHub URLs for raw user content are needed.

\examples{
# A valid URL to a data file in GitHub can be
# obtained from the HEAD of the default branch
# from_github(
#   file = "inst/data_files/small_table.csv",
#   repo = "rich-iannone/pointblank"
# )

# The path to the file location can be supplied
# fully or partially to `subdir`
# from_github(
#   file = "small_table.csv",
#   repo = "rich-iannone/pointblank",
#   subdir = "inst/data_files"
# )

# We can use the first call in combination with
# `file_tbl()` and `create_agent()`; this
# supplies a table-prep formula that gets
# a CSV file from the GitHub repository for the
# pointblank package 
# agent <- 
#   create_agent(
#     read_fn = ~ file_tbl(
#       file = from_github(
#         file = "inst/data_files/small_table.csv",
#         repo = "rich-iannone/pointblank"
#       ),
#       col_types = "TDdcddlc"
#     )
#   ) \%>\%
#   col_vals_gt(vars(a), 0) \%>\%
#   interrogate()

# The `from_github()` helper function is
# pretty powerful and can get at lots of
# different files in a repository

# A data file from GitHub can be obtained from
# a commit at release time
# from_github(
#   file = "inst/extdata/small_table.csv",
#   repo = "rich-iannone/pointblank@v0.2.1"
# )

# A file may also be obtained from a repo at the
# point in time of a specific commit (partial or
# full SHA-1 hash for the commit can be used)
# from_github(
#   file = "data-raw/small_table.csv",
#   repo = "rich-iannone/pointblank@e04a71"
# )

# A file may also be obtained from an
# *open* pull request
# from_github(
#   file = "data-raw/small_table.csv",
#   repo = "rich-iannone/pointblank#248"
# )
