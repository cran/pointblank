\title{Read an \emph{agent}, \emph{informant}, \emph{multiagent}, or table scan from disk}
\usage{
x_read_disk(filename, path = NULL, quiet = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{filename}{The name of a file that was previously written by
\code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}}.}

\item{path}{An optional path to the file (combined with \code{filename}).}

\item{quiet}{Should the function \emph{not} inform when the file is read? By
default this is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
Either a \code{ptblank_agent}, \code{ptblank_informant}, or a
\code{ptblank_tbl_scan} object.
}
\description{
An \emph{agent}, \emph{informant}, \emph{multiagent}, or table scan that has been written to
disk (with \code{\link[=x_write_disk]{x_write_disk()}}) can be read back into memory with the
\code{x_read_disk()} function. For an \emph{agent} or an \emph{informant} object that has
been generated in this way, it may not have a data table associated with it
(depending on whether the \code{keep_tbl} option was \code{TRUE} or \code{FALSE} when
writing to disk) but it should still be able to produce reporting (by
printing the \emph{agent} or \emph{informant} to the console or using
\code{\link[=get_agent_report]{get_agent_report()}}/\code{\link[=get_informant_report]{get_informant_report()}}). An \emph{agent} will return an
x-list with \code{\link[=get_agent_x_list]{get_agent_x_list()}} and yield any available data extracts with
\code{\link[=get_data_extracts]{get_data_extracts()}}. Furthermore, all of an \emph{agent}'s validation steps will
still be present (along with results from the last interrogation).
}
\details{
Should a written-to-disk \emph{agent} or \emph{informant} possess a table-prep formula
or a specific in-memory tablewe could use the \code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}} or
\code{\link[=incorporate]{incorporate()}} function again. For a \emph{data quality reporting} workflow, it
is useful to \code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}} target tables that evolve over time. While the
same validation steps will be used, more can be added before calling
\code{\link[=interrogate]{interrogate()}}. For an \emph{information management} workflow with an \emph{informant}
object, using \code{\link[=incorporate]{incorporate()}} will update aspects of the reporting such as
table dimensions, and info snippets/text will be regenerated.

# A: Reading an agent from disk 

# The process of developing an agent

# `x_write_disk()` function is explained

# that's named "agent-small_table.rds",
# we could read that to a new agent
# object with `x_read_disk()`

# B: Reading an informant from disk

# If there is an informant written

# named "informant-small_table.rds",
# we could read that to a new informant
# object with `x_read_disk()`
informant <-

# C: Reading a multiagent from disk 

# The process of creating a multiagent
# and writing it to disk with the
# `x_write_disk()` function is shown
# in that function's documentation;
# but should we have such a written file
# called "multiagent-small_table.rds",

# D: Reading a table scan from disk

# If there is a table scan written
# to disk via `x_write_disk()` and it's
# named "tbl_scan-storms.rds", we could
# read it back into R with `x_read_disk()`
tbl_scan <-
