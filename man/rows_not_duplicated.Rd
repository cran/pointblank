\usage{
rows_not_duplicated(
  x,
  columns = NULL,
  preconditions = NULL,
  brief = NULL,
  actions = NULL,
  active = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{An agent object of class \code{ptblank_agent}.}

\item{columns}{The column (or a set of columns, provided as a character
vector) to which this validation should be applied.}

\item{preconditions}{expressions used for mutating the input table before
proceeding with the validation. This is ideally as a one-sided R formula
using a leading \code{~}. In the formula representation, the \code{tbl} serves as the
input data table to be transformed (e.g.,
\code{~ tbl \%>\% dplyr::mutate(col = col + 10)}. A series of expressions can be
used by enclosing the set of statements with \code{{ }} but note that the \code{tbl}
object must be ultimately returned.}

\item{brief}{An optional, text-based description for the validation step.}

\item{actions}{A list containing threshold levels so that the validation step
can react accordingly when exceeding the set levels. This is to be created
with the \code{\link[=action_levels]{action_levels()}} helper function.}

\item{active}{A logical value indicating whether the validation step should
be active. If the step function is working with an agent, \code{FALSE} will make
the validation step inactive (still reporting its presence and keeping
indexes for the steps unchanged). If the step function will be operating
directly on data, then any step with \code{active = FALSE} will simply pass the
data through with no validation whatsoever. The default for this is \code{TRUE}.}
