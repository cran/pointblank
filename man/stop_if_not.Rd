\title{The next generation of \code{stopifnot()}-type functions: \code{stop_if_not()}}
\usage{
stop_if_not(...)
}
\arguments{
\item{...}{R expressions that should each evaluate to (a logical vector of
all) \code{TRUE}.}
}
\value{
\code{NULL} if all statements in \code{...} are \code{TRUE}.
}
\description{
This is \code{stopifnot()} but with a twist: it works well as a standalone,
replacement for \code{stopifnot()} but is also customized for use in validation
checks in R Markdown documents where \strong{pointblank} is loaded. Using
\code{stop_if_not()} in a code chunk where the \code{validate = TRUE} option is set
will yield the correct reporting of successes and failures whereas
\code{stopifnot()} \emph{does not}.
}
\examples{
# This checks whether the number of
# rows in `small_table` is greater
# than `10`
stop_if_not(nrow(small_table) > 10)

# This will stop for sure: there
# isn't a `time` column in `small_table`
# (but there are the `date_time` and
# `date` columns)
# stop_if_not("time" \%in\% colnames(small_table))

# You're not bound to using tabular
# data here, any statements that
# evaluate to logical vectors will work
stop_if_not(1:5 < 20:25)
